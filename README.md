# Pwd-Generator-Danyon

## Description

In this project I have built a randomised Password Generator using JavaScript.

My Motivation: To put into practice the JavaScript skills I have been taught over the last week of class.

Why did I build this?: Everyone needs secure passwords these days, so I built this to create myself strong passwords that I can use to keep my accounts secure.

What Problems did this solve?: This resolves peoples needs to manually create secure and unique passwords for their accounts. It also assists people in replacing old, weaker passwords with newer, stronger ones.

What did I learn?: I learned how I can use JavaScript variables, functions and objects to create an interactive and responsive website.
